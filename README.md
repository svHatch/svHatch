Hello. My name is Scott Hatcher (svHatch).

I'm interested in GIS and Remote Sensing. My work involves using drones to help the Coast Guard do its work. In my free time I write scripts to perform geospatial analysis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python a bit more deeply.

I am looking to collaborate on software the contributes to the open source geospatial field.
